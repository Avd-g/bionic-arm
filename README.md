üñêÔ∏è Robotic Hand ‚Äì Articulated 3D Model (SolidWorks)
This repository contains the complete CAD design of an anatomically inspired robotic hand, modeled using SolidWorks. The design replicates human hand structure and movement, featuring multiple degrees of freedom across all fingers and an opposable thumb. Ideal for robotics applications, prosthetic development, and educational demonstrations.

üî© Key Features
Fully Articulated Fingers
Each of the four fingers includes three segments (phalanges) and three revolute joints, mimicking natural bending motions.

Opposable Thumb
Two-segment design with ergonomic curvature allows gripping and pinching tasks.

Modular Palm Structure
Designed with clean geometric segmentation for actuator housing, wiring, and easy printing or fabrication.

Simulation-Ready Geometry
Clean and constraint-free SolidWorks parts suitable for integration with kinematic solvers or motion analysis.

üß† Possible Use Cases
Robotic prosthetic hand prototypes

Teleoperated robotic manipulators

Machine learning-based grasping research

VR/AR haptic interface studies

Educational demonstration in mechatronics and biomechanics

üöÄ Future Development Ideas
Integration with servo/motor actuation or tendon-based control

EMG/EEG-based real-time control simulation

Embedded sensor mounts (force, flex, tactile)

Soft robotic material versioning
